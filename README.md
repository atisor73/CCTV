This repository is a home for our website dedicated to the lovely species <em>Caulobacter Crescentus </em> for BeBi103 Fall 2019 @Caltech. The original data was made available to us via the [Scherer Lab](https://schererlab.uchicago.edu/) @UChicago. 
A sister repository [here](https://github.com/atisor73/caulobacter) takes on a more user-friendly approach to our data.
The team consists of Rosita Fu, Theresa Marlin, and Erika Salzman.


#### `assets`
This directory stores all the stylesheets (.css) and font files (.otf and .ttf) cloned from [Griffin Chure's repository](https://github.com/gchure/).


Future edits to the website will hopefully include successful html embedding of interactive plots and greater ease in the navigational structure of the page (less scrolling, more clicking).
