This repository is a home for our website dedicated to the lovely species <em>Caulobacter Crescentus </em> for BeBi103 Fall 2019 @Caltech. A sister repository [here](https://github.com/atisor73/caulobacter) takes on a more user-friendly approach to our data analysis.
The original data was made available to us via the [Scherer Lab](https://schererlab.uchicago.edu/) @UChicago. 
The team consists of Rosita Fu, Theresa Marlin, and Erika Salzman.

Most of the directories survive to figure out how file paths work for the `index.html` file and sustain the website itself. The `assets` directory stores all the stylesheets (.css) and font files (.otf and .ttf) cloned from [Griffin Chure's](https://github.com/gchure/) repository.

Future edits to the website will hopefully include successful html embedding of interactive plots and greater ease in the navigational structure of the page (less scrolling, more clicking). Furthermore, our analysis has received feedback and will hopefully evolve to present our conclusions in a more sensible manner.
